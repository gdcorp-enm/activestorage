*   Fixes proxy downloads of files over 5mb 

    Previously, trying to view and/or download files larger than 5mb stored in
    services like S3 via proxy mode could return corrupted files at around
    5.2mb or cause random halts in the download. Now,
    `ActiveStorage::Blobs::ProxyController` correctly handles streaming these
    larger files from the service to the client without any issues.

    Fixes #44679

*   Saving attachment(s) to a record returns the blob/blobs object

    Previously, saving attachments did not return the blob/blobs that
    were attached. Now, saving attachments to a record with `#attach`
    method returns the blob or array of blobs that were attached to
    the record. If it fails to save the attachment(s), then it returns
    `false`.

*   Don't stream responses in redirect mode

    Previously, both redirect mode and proxy mode streamed their
    responses which caused a new thread to be created, and could end
    up leaking connections in the connection pool. But since redirect
    mode doesn't actually send any data, it doesn't need to be
    streamed.
